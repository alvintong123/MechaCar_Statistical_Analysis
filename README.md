## Linear Regression to Predict MPG 
1) The variables/coefficients that did not provide non-random variance were vehicle_length and ground_clearance since they do not posess significant influence to the data indicated by the Significance Codes.  
2) Our slope of our Linear Regression would be considered non-zero since our significance value (p) is 5.35e-11. 
3) I think this linear model could be a somewhat good indicator of Mecha prototypes. Our R-squared value is 0.7149. The R-squared value tells us how much the dependent variable (mpg) is influenced by the independent variable (coefficients). This R-squared value tells us that roughly 72% of the mpg is influenced by the coefficients making this model pretty reliable.

## Summary Statistics on Suspension Coils

In the image above we have a complete summary of the PSI data in the Suspension Coil data set. We see that we have a Mean of 1498.78, Median of 1500, Variance of 62.30, and a Standard Deviation of 7.90. To answer our question, the variance of suspension coils does not exceed the 100 pound per square inch requirement for all Lots aggregated. However, when we do a summary for each Lot individually we see that Lots 1 and 2 pass, but Lot 3 has a variance of 170.3 which is over the requirement.  
## T-Test on Suspension Coils

For the lots as a whole the p-value is 0.06028 which means there is  significant evidence to accept the null hypothesis since our value is greater than 0.05. This would mean that there is no real statistical difference between the samples and population. However, when we look the lots individually we see that some lots do not make the cut. Lot 1 has a p-value of 1, Lot 2 with a p-value of 0.61, and Lot 3 with a p-value of 0.04. This means Lot 1 is even with the mean of the population which also indicates that this lot satisfies the requirement. Lot 2's p-value means that there is plausible reasoning to accept the null hypothesis that there is no correlation between PSI and Suspension Coils from Lot 2. Lot 3's p-value tells us we can reasonably reject the null hypothesis and say there is a correlation between PSI and Suspenion Coils from Lot 3. 
## Study Design: MechaCar vs. Competition 
I think that an useful metric to test would be fuel efficiency and possibly reliability along with it. My null hypothesis would be the MechaCar will perform at the average metrics of other competitors in terms of fuel efficiency and reliability. My alternative hypothesis would be the MechaCar will perform not at the average of other competitors in terms of fuel efficiency and reliability. For this analysis I would run a T-Test between the two means of MechaCar and competitors. We want to see if there is a significant difference between the means of either MechaCar and competitors and the T-Test is the best way to do so. Depending on our p-value we can either reject or accpet the null hypothesis and see if there is a performance difference worth noting. The data needed to run this test would be significant data points relating to fuel efficiency numbers like highway and city mpg and possibly how much each customer spends on gas each month. As for reliability we can record how often each type of vehicle has to be servieced along with how long each service takes.
